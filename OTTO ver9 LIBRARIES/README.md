# Libraries
# Importing these Libraries
These Libraries are distributed as a folder. The name of the folder is the name of the library. Inside each of the folders will be a .cpp file, a .h file and often a keywords.txt file, examples folder, and other files required by the library. Starting with Arduino IDE version 1.0.5, you can install 3rd party libraries in the IDE. 

Each library is required to be able program your Otto version 9.

Download this GitHub repository using the GREEN "Clone or download" button on the main page, this will download all these folders as a ZIP file, you will need to unzip the folders when the ZIP file has finished downloading, make a note where they are located (usually your Download folder).

Find the location of your Arduino IDE sketch book folder:
You can find or change the location of your sketchbook folder by starting the Arduino IDE and click on the tabs ... File > Preferences > Sketchbook location. 


Copy all the UNZIPPED downloaded library folders into the “libraries” folder inside your sketchbook. 

Restart the Arduino IDE again to be able to use the libraries.
